## üåü Key Features

### **2D Simulation (Pygame)**
- **Real-time interaction**: Place mirrors dynamically with mouse clicks.
- **Ray tracing**: Simulate reflections with collision detection and vector-based physics.
- **Multi-ray support**: Emit light rays in customizable directions.
- **Bounce limits**: Prevent infinite loops with controlled reflection counts.

### **3D Simulation (Panda3D)**
- **3D light propagation**: Rays interact with planes in a 3D space.
- **Reflective surfaces**: Model mirrors using collision detection and normals.
- **Dynamic camera**: Explore patterns from any angle with default camera controls.
- **Expandable geometry**: Easily add complex shapes or multiple mirrors.
